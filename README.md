📱 Mobile App \& Retailer API Installation Guide

-----------------------------------



This guide explains how to install and use our advanced receipt and warranty management system, both from the mobile application and the retailer web interface.



-------------------------------------------

🧠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW – THE FUTURE OF RECEIPT TRACKING

-------------------------------------------



Our system is designed to completely eliminate the need for paper receipts and physical warranty cards by automatically digitizing and organizing them in one secure place.



-------------------------

🌟 Core System Components

-------------------------

1\. \*\*User Mobile Application\*\* – For regular users to:

&nbsp;  - Track receipts, warranties, and purchases.

&nbsp;  - Use AI-powered insights to analyze spending habits.

&nbsp;  - View total expenditures over any time period.

&nbsp;  - Search for products and understand purchase behavior.



2\. \*\*Retailer Web API Portal\*\* – For retailers to:

&nbsp;  - Add users by CPR or customer ID.

&nbsp;  - Push receipts and warranties directly to the customer's account.

&nbsp;  - Integrate with Point-of-Sale (POS) systems.



---------------------------------------------------

🚀 Key Benefits \& Features – Why This System Wins

---------------------------------------------------



✅ \*\*Automatic Receipt \& Warranty Storage\*\*

&nbsp;  - Once a user makes a purchase, the retailer’s system (when integrated) sends the receipt directly to the user’s app – no manual input needed.



✅ \*\*Real-Time Financial Insights\*\*

&nbsp;  - Users can see how much they spent this month, last month, or over custom periods.

&nbsp;  - AI automatically categorizes purchases into smart groups (e.g., Electronics, Food, Clothing).

&nbsp;  - Filter and analyze per item, category, supplier, or brand.

&nbsp;  - Search "Apple" and see all Apple product purchases and total spending.



✅ \*\*Paperless Warranty Management\*\*

&nbsp;  - Users no longer need to save or scan warranty cards.

&nbsp;  - Warranty details, period, and supplier information are stored securely.



✅ \*\*AI OCR Receipt Scanner\*\*

&nbsp;  - For unlinked purchases, users can scan physical receipts using their camera.

&nbsp;  - AI extracts and fills in the details automatically.



✅ \*\*Advanced Fraud Detection (Admin Only)\*\*

&nbsp;  - Admins can log in and access a fraud detection module.

&nbsp;  - The system uses pattern recognition to detect suspicious activity.

&nbsp;  - This includes \*\*cash-based fraud\*\*, something even banks often miss.



✅ \*\*P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Agreement System\*\*

&nbsp;  - Users can create digital agreements with other users.

&nbsp;  - Examples: Lending money, service agreements, rental conditions.

&nbsp;  - Both parties agree to the terms, and the contract is stored in the cloud.

&nbsp;  - Once accepted, it becomes a valid digital agreement with timestamps and terms.



✅ \*\*Offline-to-Cloud Bridge\*\*

&nbsp;  - Even if a transaction was done in cash or offline, it can be stored securely using our retailer or AI OCR tools.

&nbsp;  - This makes every purchase meaningful and reportable.
