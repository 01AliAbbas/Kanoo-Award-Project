Our system is designed to completely eliminate the need for paper receipts and physical warranty cards by automatically digitizing and organizing them in one secure place.  

### 🌟 Core System Components

   - View total expenditures over any time period.  
   - Search for products and understand purchase behavior.  

2. **Retailer Web API Portal** – For retailers to:

   - Push receipts and warranties directly to the customer's account.  
   - Integrate with Point-of-Sale (POS) systems.

## 🚀 Key Benefits & Features – Why This System Wins  

✅ **Automatic Receipt & Warranty Storage**  
   - Once a user makes a purchase, the retailer's system (when integrated) sends the receipt directly to the user's app – no manual input needed.  

✅ **Real-Time Financial Insights**  
   - Users can see how much they spent this month, last month, or over custom periods.  
   - AI automatically categorizes purchases into smart groups (e.g., Electronics, Food, Clothing).  
   - Filter and analyze per item, category, supplier, or brand.  
   - Search "Apple" and see all Apple product purchases and total spending.  

✅ **Paperless Warranty Management**  
   - Users no longer need to save or scan warranty cards.  
   - Warranty details, period, and supplier information are stored securely.  

✅ **AI OCR Receipt Scanner**  
   - For unlinked purchases, users can scan physical receipts using their camera.  
   - AI extracts and fills in the details automatically.  

✅ **Advanced Fraud Detection (Admin Only)**  
   - Admins can log in and access a fraud detection module.  
   - The system uses pattern recognition to detect suspicious activity.  
   - This includes **cash-based fraud**, something even banks often miss.  

✅ **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Agreement System**  
   - Users can create digital agreements with other users.  
   - Examples: Lending money, service agreements, rental conditions.  
   - Both parties agree to the terms, and the contract is stored in the cloud.  
   - Once accepted, it becomes a valid digital agreement with timestamps and terms.  

✅ **Offline-to-Cloud Bridge**  
   - Even if a transaction was done in cash or offline, it can be stored securely using our retailer or AI OCR tools.  
   - This makes every purchase meaningful and reportable.
